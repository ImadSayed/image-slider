## This project is to demonstrate an image slider component. It loads the images in the storage/app/public/images/ folder.
# It may eventually get build further to allow the user to upload some new images to show in the slider.

# After cloning the repository and running npm install in your terminal

# Assuming you have PHP installed and it is in your path / system environment variables, run the following in your terminal: php artisan storage:link
# This will create a link between your storage and public folder to access the images.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# To launch the server and test the imageSlider, locally, run the following in your terminal: composer run dev
# Alternatively you may start your server separately using: php artisan serve
# and then start the hot module using: npm run dev

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After starting the server, open a browser and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8000/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Using the image slider in the broswer;
# - click on the navigational buttons.
# - if you are able to use touch mode then try and swipe the slider. Maybe even try to flick the slide instead of sliding across the entire screen.
# - select Auto Play in the top right corner.
# - click on one of the dots in the long line of dots towards the bottom / center of the image slider.
